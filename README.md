# replitDiscordMomBot.js
This is a chatbot for my discord server. 
It uses the OpenAi api for responces.
It's being hosted on replit.com and will not work if you try to run it from your own machine.
In order for this to work on other machines you will need to create a .env file, then replace the OpenAi code and the discord ID found in replit's "secrets" mechanic.
